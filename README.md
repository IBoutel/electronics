## Naming Convention
Project are named in the following manner:

`K<t>-<n>-<v>`

Where `t` is the type of project; `n` is the project number; `v` is the project version. The type can either be `D` for a non-computer device (e.g. battery charger); `C` for a computer (e.g. microcontroller board); `E` for an extension module (e.g. arduino shield).

An example could be `KC-2-3`, which would be the second computer I designed in its 3rd version.
